I work as a data analyst at [LCP](https://www.lcpproperties.co.uk/) and spend a lot of time performing on the side. My interests are evenly split between VisualPDE: a rapid-interactive PDE solver and music! See below for a simulation you can play with.

I would like to call myself a mathematician but I don't think thats a title I'm ready for just yet. In the meantime I'll go by _enthusiastic bystander_ who likes pattern formation in dynamical systems and with an eagerness to throw CPUs at a problem. I could call myself a Musician but that would be an outright lie.
